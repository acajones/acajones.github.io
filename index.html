  <h1 class="center">Welcome</h1>
  <div class="center">I am a Software Engineering Student at Iowa state with a wide array of interests and skills. Please take a look at my protfolio for a look at my skills and experiece.</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>After my graduation in December 2018, I would like to work at a company that helps me lead the kind of life that I choose while simultaneously allowing me to do important work that could benefit many people. I know that I could help a company like this excel in their business, as I would be extremely passionate about what I do.</div>

<h2>General Education</h2>

<div>My current goal is securing an internship for the summer of 2018 that will teach me new skills that I have not yet learned for the professional setting. In the long term I hope to have a position that will allow me to feel like I am making a difference in the world. This may either be developing software that could help in a humanitarian sense, or by working at a smaller business that I can help to grow and eventually provide employment to many people. 

	In my many years of education I have learned many technical aspects that have helped me excel in the software development field. Though this is important, the main strength I have through my education has been the ability to problem solve. One class that has helped me greatly in looking at problems from different perspectives is the American Indians class I enrolled in. This class was about American Indian society in the present day, and how they were impacted throughout history to become what they are today in American Society. This class taught me that there are many sides to every problem. Also, that you may think you fully understand a problem, when in reality, you have not even begun to understand the problem fully. This has taught me to slow down when trying to understand a problem because if you try to start to solve a problem before you fully understand it, you will inevitably end up wasting time.

My General Education classes have taught me that when I get a job in the software field, I must not forget that there are many other jobs and fields out there. I must consider the lawyer I am making legal software for, or the doctor I am making patient tracking software for. If I use a “one size fits all” approach, my software will lack all creativity and most likely will not get the job done as well as it could have been.</div>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<div>Online Game - 
In a class with two other programmers, we designed and developed an online, browser based game for an entire semester. We first decided how we were going to make this game. We decided on a browser based game using HTML, Javascript and PHP to communicate with a MySQL server. We chose this because none of us had experience with these, and we wanted to learn something new. We first focused on a single player experience making sure movement and attacks worked well. We then had to implement the online experience. Using Node.js we were able to get four players to battle through the Internet.</div>



<div>Sailbot - 
	This is a group within M:2:I where we design a fully autonomous sailboat to compete in a yearly competition against other groups like ours. We must coordinate with the electronics team and the mechanical team to make this boat fully functional. We first focused on designing the manual control aspect. This is because many of the aspects of manual control can be applied to the autonomous algorithm, and we did not want to jump into something too complex too quickly.

	For M:2:I all teams have a large presentation every semester. This presentation involves the current progress on the project, and the plans for the semester. Being the main software programmer, I had to present most of the software related information. This involved looking through code written in the past, and also planning what we were going to accomplish in the future.

	The resources that I used the most throughout these projects was students that were more experienced in my current task. Whether they were TAs or team leads in Sailbot, they could always help or at least point me in the right direction.</div>

<div>Unix Shell -
In CprE 308 I had to design and program a custom Unix based shell in C. This shell involved taking user input and performing commands or running a program. I decided on an while loop that would get user input, parse the input by whitespace and execute the command with an output of 0 or 1. If the output was 1, the loop will end. I also made it possible to run a process in the background, so one could run other commands while a process is finishing up. I learned how processes and subprocesses work in a system and I strengthened my grasp on C.</div>


<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<div>Maverick Software Consulting - 
	During my time at Maverick I have worked within two teams at Thomson Reuters. During my time on my first team I helped to convert from the old testing system base in Fitnesse, to a new testing system using JSON objects run through a Java program. I also helped to develop this Java program
	
	When this project was wrapping up I was switched to the Legal Analytics team where I currently am programming regression testing software. We have an Agile based system with daily scrum meetings. I regularly have contact with my team members to keep my efficiency at its very best.</div>

<h2>Senior Design Project</h2>
	
	<div>For my senior design project my team is designing and producing a pilot biometrics device for Rockwell Collins. This device involves tracking a pilot's ECG readings and determining if the pilot is unable to effectively pilot the craft. My role on this team, as the only Software Engineering Major, is Algorithm Designer. This involves taking the filtered ECG readings and determining from previous data the current status of the pilot. Because lives will literally depend on our device working correctly, we must make absolutely sure that it always works as expected. For example, if there is a false positive for the pilot being too stressed and they are told to land, the pilot will be extremely anger, and if we do not pick up a pilot in distress they could lose motor control and crash the craft. Neither of these scenarios are very desirable so an abundance of testing must be done on our device.</div>

<div>This will solve the issue of ground control not knowing exactly what’s going on with a pilot in the cockpit when an issue arises. For example, if the ground crew sees a pilot is not flying correctly or their vitals are off in some way, they will tell the pilot to land. This usually makes the pilot very anger because that means the mission is scrapped. With our device, the ground crew can show the pilot exactly what was going on with the plane or with their bodies and help them understand why they were told to land. Another issue is that the craft usually will not know if it should engage autopilot. With our device we can detect if a pilot is unconscious which can trigger autopilot until the pilot regains consciousness. Our device can clearly help save many lives and avoid catastrophe, and I hope it becomes widespread in the future. </div>


<h2>Reflection</h2>
<div>During my time here at Iowa State I have learned how to make great solutions to difficult problems. I have learned how to solve difficult problems in class like ComS 311, where I had to design and prove complex algorithms. I have also learned how to look at problems from different angles and to not assume to understand a problem before knowing all the facts in American Indians. 
	I pride myself on my ability to integrate into a group and learned from them, well as teach them what I know. I have taken many classes where I have worked in a group. One such class in ComS 309 where I worked in a group of three to design the online game mentioned above. I have also learned a lot from Sailbot. It has taught me how to talk to other field, such as Aerospace Engineers and Electrical Engineers, and to coordinate with them to get a complex task done.
	Career Fairs have taught me that the more I learn in my field, the my I can spot others that want to never stop learning. When I start my career I can go to career fairs to represent my company and help to spot others who never want to stop learning. 
	I enjoy personal projects for many different applications. One such project is an Alexa Application I developed and am still improving. This application uses Node.js along with the AWS api and Amazon Developer. I also have done personal projects with an Arduino Uno (a microcontroller) and a Raspberry Pi. Though the Arduino is more on the hardware side I like to learn new things, even though I will most likely fail at first. 
  In regards to what I would do differently if I could do undergrad over again, I think that I would try and make more time for different clubs that I was always interested in. Sadly most of my time has been taken up be my current job and by Sailbot so joining another organization would not have allowed me to excel at the organizations I was currently in. </div>
